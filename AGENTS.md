# Ship Dễ — Operating card

## Source of truth

Read these sources before changing code, in this precedence order:

1. `docs/product-spec/docs/00-control/BASELINE-AND-DECISIONS.md`
2. `docs/product-spec/docs/01-product/PRODUCT-VISION-SCOPE.md`
3. `docs/product-spec/docs/01-product/MASTER-FEATURE-CATALOG.md`
4. Business rules, state machines, API/data contracts and screen specifications under `docs/product-spec/docs/`
5. The current Work Item and its acceptance matrix
6. Existing code

Existing code is implementation evidence, not business authority. If code and specification conflict, stop and record the conflict; do not silently choose one.

## One Work Item per branch and Pull Request

- One branch and one Pull Request contain exactly one `FEAT-*`, `TASK-FOUND-*`, `TASK-AI-*` or Controller goal item `GOAL-<GOAL>-<n>` Work Item.
- Branch: `feat/<lowercase-work-item-id>-<short-slug>` or `fix/<lowercase-work-item-id>-<short-slug>`.
- Pull Request title: `[<WORK_ITEM_ID>] <business outcome>`.
- Do not combine unrelated cleanup, refactoring or another feature.

## Verification commands

- `pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile` (production-install regression gate; run from a clean checkout)
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- `pnpm db:generate`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm format:check`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm test:e2e`
- `pnpm test:baseline`
- `pnpm test:brain`
- `pnpm security:secrets`
- `pnpm build`

## Definition of Done

A feature is vertical, not UI-only. Where applicable it includes:

- [ ] user-visible flow and loading, empty, validation, error, forbidden, partial, success and recovery states;
- [ ] API/application behavior and canonical errors;
- [ ] persistence, migrations and seed/test fixtures;
- [ ] tenant scope, authorization, audit and sensitive-data handling;
- [ ] external adapter behavior, timeout, idempotency, reconciliation and manual fallback;
- [ ] unit, integration and end-to-end acceptance evidence;
- [ ] OpenAPI/schema, traceability and operational documentation updates.

- [ ] No fake primary action, production hardcode, hidden TODO or success toast without a real committed outcome is allowed.
- [ ] New behavior requires tests at the lowest useful level plus the Work Item acceptance path.
- [ ] A changed contract requires consumer, schema and compatibility checks.
- [ ] Pull Request evidence includes every [required item](docs/product-spec/docs/10-ai-collaboration/AGENT-CONTRACT-DETAILS.md#pull-request-evidence).
- [ ] `scripts/ai/check-no-hardcode.mjs` passes.

## Hard prohibitions

- Secrets and unnecessary PII must not appear in logs, snapshots, errors or fixtures.
- Every tenant-owned read and write is scoped server-side; never trust client-supplied ownership.
- VND must not use floating-point arithmetic.
- A timed-out create, cancel, redelivery or claim command must reconcile remote state before retry; blind retries that can duplicate an external effect are prohibited.
- No fake primary action.
- Never touch gate configs, allowlists, baselines, semgrep, or `.github/` without explicit approval.
- The author never approves its own work. A feature is not complete because an author says it is complete.

## Role separation

- **Claude — analyst, secondary author and reviewer fallback:** host-authenticated Claude Code CLI only; independent review fallback when cloud reviewers hit rate limits and assigned repair/authoring; never third-party API quotas.
- **Codex — planner/document owner:** prepares the dependency-ready Work Item from approved sources, chooses `GEMINI`, `CLAUDE`, or `9ROUTER`, sets the register to `READY_FOR_AUTHOR`; no production code during planning.
- **9Router worker — constrained author:** assigned low-risk deterministic work only; stop at architecture, authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, money, carrier side effects, database ownership or product UX decisions.
- **Gemini — primary author:** plans and implements complete foundation or vertical Work Items, adds evidence and opens/updates the Pull Request.
- **Codex — independent reviewer:** fresh review-only task against the full Pull Request, Work Item and sources; `PASS`, `CHANGES_REQUIRED` or `BLOCKED`; does not merge or silently fix. **Human — product and merge owner:** resolves decisions, triggers gates, accepts residual risk and merges only after green CI and Codex `PASS`; the [existing conditional controller merge authorization](docs/product-spec/docs/10-ai-collaboration/AGENT-CONTRACT-DETAILS.md#role-separation) remains unchanged.
